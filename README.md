This web application provides an interactive interface to explore and understand various aspects of AI governance.
Huge shout out to James ( https://github.com/The-Company-Ethos/doing-ai-governance ) and his blog at https://www.ethos-ai.org/ for providing well researched and relevant literature and grouping of AI Governance domains + controls.

These are the 12 doamins and there are 44 controls across all domains:
Governance & Leadership (GL-1 to GL-3)
Risk Management (RM-1 to RM-4)
Regulatory Operations (RO-1 to RO-4)
System, Data and Model Lifecycle (LC-1 to LC-5)
Security & Engineering (SE-1 to SE-5)
Safe Responsible AI (RS-1 to RS-5)
Privacy (PR-1 to PR-4)
Assurance and Audit (AA-1 to AA-3)
Operational Monitoring (OM-1 to OM-3)
